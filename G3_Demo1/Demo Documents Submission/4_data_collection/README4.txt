The data collection is done through a real time cloud database in firebase. We used JavaScript to implement it's functionality. This code embedded into the html code. In order to run the database you need to instantiate it inside of the html script file. It is inside of the html file because when the code was built outside of the file, imported in, and called a runtime error appeared stating the webpage was attempting to load and retrieve information before the database was ever created and called. 
The JavaScript code is placed at the bottom of the html file. To run the connection you must place the JavaScript wrap around the configuration code and instantiate the database,  cloud firestore. You must then create the collection and the document if it does not already exist. Add in the components using JavaScript source <src> files in html script tags. You can not run the scripts independently. Without having the rest of the code attached the database functionality cannot be implemented. The database collection is embedded in html and you need to serve it locally and deploy the entire site in order for it to be active.
